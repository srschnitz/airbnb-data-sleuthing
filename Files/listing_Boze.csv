We are originally from Connecticut and have lots of family there that we visit regularly. I’ve been back in Bozeman full time for about 8 years and love all the many activities MT has to offer including skiing, snow shoeing, hiking, cycling, camping, tennis, pickleball, yoga  and so much more. 

I have two sons, one who graduated from the US Naval Academy Annapolis and is now a Marine Officer stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The other graduated from University College London, England Medical School and is currently working as a doctor in London and is a competitive rower. 

I’m busy managing my rental properties located on the edge of the MSU campus and our lovely Yellow Dogs guest Cottage along with working as a Property Manager for others. 

Our Yellow Dogs are named Rumo & Tater.  You will occasionally see them playing and chasing balls in the fenced in backyard.

I love spaces so much that I got into Real Estate,  and now I get to visit new spaces for a living. 

So of course when I travel I like to visit not only new cities and places, but also new houses and spaces.  Unfortunately I’ve been too busy working on various projects over the past few years to travel much, but I escape when I can!!

I’m also in the process of acquiring a place to build my own dream vacation cabin - which I will be happily sharing with the BNB community in the (semi-near-ish) future.  

That said, a few things about me... I love the “golden rule,” hate ignorance; love skiing and hiking, hate the ugly boots that go with them; love reading books, hate getting older and (almost) needing reading glasses; love karma, hate when it catches up to someone too late ;).  

I appreciate anyone who shares their space with me, and promise to treat it as I would my own - ie I’ll leave my boots at the door before I go curl up with a good book in the comfiest chair.

I grew up in the military; moving around, traveling to amazing places, and forming life-long relationships with amazing people.  Now that I no longer move around, having my homes in Airbnb is a great way to have new people come my way!

I live in Bozeman, MT and take advantage of all there is to offer. Love finding the hidden treasures in this state.  I have rental homes in Bozeman and Livingston, MT and Sun Valley (Ketchum), ID.  They are all in the downtown areas, all in wonderful little towns.  Someday, I may find myself beep bopping from one to the other.

I currently sell real estate in Montana, so if you come this way and fall in love, like everyone does... you know who to call!
